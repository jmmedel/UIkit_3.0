Background
A collection of utility classes to add different backgrounds to elements.

Usage
To apply a background color to an element, add one of the following classes. The actual color for each modifier is defined by the UIkit style that you have chosen or customized.

CLASS	DESCRIPTION
.uk-background-default	Applies the default background color.
.uk-background-muted	Applies a muted background color.
.uk-background-primary	Applies the primary background color.
.uk-background-secondary	Applies a secondary background color.
<div class="uk-background-primary"></div>
NOTE To adapt your content for better visibility on each background, add the .uk-light or .uk-dark class from the Inverse component. Use the Padding component to add some padding to the elements.

Size modifiers
This component features classes to specify the size of background images by keeping its intrinsic ratio.

CLASS	DESCRIPTION
.uk-background-cover	Scales the background image to completely cover the containing area.
.uk-background-contain	Scales the background image as far as its width and height can fit inside the containing area.
NOTE When using these classes, the background position automatically shifts to the middle and background-repeat is set to no-repeat.

No repeat
To keep smaller images from repeating to fill the background area, add the .uk-background-norepeat class.

<div class="uk-background-norepeat"></div>
Attachment
You can also apply a fixed background attachment, so that the image remains in its position while scrolling the site.

<div class="uk-background-fixed"></div>

Responsive
Add one of the following classes to limit the display of background images to certain viewport sizes. This is great in cases where the image and content overlap on a phone screen in a way that would make text illegible.

CLASS	DESCRIPTION
.uk-background-image@s	Displays the background image on device widths of 640px and larger.
.uk-background-image@m	Displays the background image on device widths of 960px and larger.
.uk-background-image@l	Displays the background image on device widths of 1200px and larger.
.uk-background-image@xl	Displays the background image on device widths of 1600px and larger.
<div class="uk-background-image@m"></div>
