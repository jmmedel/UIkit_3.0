Marker
Create a marker icon that can be displayed on top of images.

Usage
To apply this component, add the uk-marker attribute to any element. You can use the Position component to place the marker on top of an image. Also add the .uk-transform-center classes from the Utility component to center the marker itself to its upper left corner.

<a href="" uk-marker></a>
NOTE Add the .uk-light or .uk-dark class, so that elements will be optimized for better visibility on dark or light images.
